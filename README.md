# Major Project

## Project Description

Trade-Alert is a notification system that keeps users updated on critical news impacting their stock portfolios. It simplifies staying informed by delivering timely notifications for important articles, eliminating the need to monitor multiple platforms in today’s fast-paced market.

## Key Features

**Personalized Notifications:** Users receive notifications tailored to their specific stock portfolio, ensuring they stay informed about relevant news.<br>
**AI/ML Integration:** Leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, Red Alert identifies and prioritizes news articles based on their potential impact on the user's investments.<br>
**Efficient Information Delivery:** Red Alert minimizes information overload by delivering only the most critical news articles, allowing users to focus on key updates without sifting through countless irrelevant sources.<br>
**MERN Stack:** The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable foundation for development.

## How It Works

**User Profile Setup:** Users create a profile and input their stock portfolio details.<br>
**AI Analysis:** Red Alert's AI algorithms continuously monitor news sources and analyze articles to identify those relevant to the user's portfolio.<br>
**Notification Delivery:** Red Alert sends a notification to the user's preferred device when significant news is detected, ensuring timely access to important information.

## Benefits

**Stay Ahead in the Game**: Users will be a step ahead in gaining relevant information about their stock portfolio among other retail investors.<br>
**Time-Saving**: Users would not have to read irrelevant articles about the things that they do not need to worry about.<br>

## Tech Stack Used

- **React** - To build a dynamic frontend to capability to render dynamically<br>
- **Express** - To build the REST APIs with protected routes using JWT and verification mail to avoid fake accounts.<br>
- **Node** - For overall javascript run time environment, used on both frontend and backend<br>
- **MongoDB** - Nosql database to store user information<br>
- **AI/Ml** - Different opensource LLMs like llama and mixtral are being planned to used.  

## How to use the Project

- Clone the project
- Install all the dependencies in the frontend and backend folder using npm install command from your console.
- Create your .env files in both frontend and backend
- Inside your frontend .env write VITE_SERVER_URL=(something if you want to host) and VITE_LOCALHOST = `http://localhost:8000`
- Inside your backend .env write PORT=8000, EMAIL_ID= Your email (for verification mail during sign up), APP_PASSWORD = (password of your google email service for nodemailer), CORS_ORIGIN = `http://localhost:5173`, MONGODB_URI = )(MongoDB atlas URL), JWT_SECRET = 1234 (JWT Token for your)
- Run the frontend and backend using npm run dev command from the console.
